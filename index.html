        <h3>What is Polymorphism?</h3>
        <p>Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming in which a single interface takes different forms (polymorphism means “many forms”). Often this means similar operations are grouped together with the same name. However, these operations with the same name will produce different results.</p>
        <h3>Method Overriding</h3>
        <p>Method overriding is another example of polymorphism that you have already seen. Overriding a method means that you have two methods with the same name, but they perform different tasks. Again you see a single interface (the method name) being used with different forms (the superclass and the subclass).</p>
        <h3>Method Overloading</h3>
        <p>Method overriding is another example of polymorphism that you have already seen. Overriding a method means that you have two methods with the same name, but they perform different tasks. Again you see a single interface (the method name) being used with different forms (the superclass and the subclass).</p>
        <p>Method overloading is another example of polymorphism. Method overloading occurs when you have a single method name that can take different sets of parameters. Imagine you want to write the method sum that can sum up to three numbers. The math involved with three parameters is slightly different than two parameters, which is different from 1 parameter, etc. Traditionally, if you declare a method that takes three parameters but only pass two, Java will throw an error message. Instead let’s create a class that has two sum methods; one with two parameters and another with three parameters.</p>
        <h3>Abstract Classes</h3>
        <p>Another form of polymorphism in Java involves abstract methods. These methods, however, require knowledge of abstract classes. So before we continue the discussion on polymorphism, we need to first talk about abstract classes.</p>
